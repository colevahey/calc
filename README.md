# calc
Calc is a problem solving calculator that can intake addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, quadratic equations, and
trigonometric right triangles. For the quadratic equations, the 
calculator finds the y intercept, the axis of symmetry, the vertex, and
SOON will be able to solve for the roots. With the trigonometric right 
triangles, using sine, cosine, and tangent functions, the calculator 
can tell all of the sides given just an angle and a side.
